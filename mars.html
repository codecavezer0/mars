<h1>WELCOME TO PLANET MARS</h1>
<h2>THE RED HOT PLANET</h2>

<p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, 
    desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
    Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, 
        polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes,
        and evidence that it was even more active in the past.
        When NASA’s Curiosity rover arrived at the “sulfate-bearing unit” last fall, scientists thought they’d seen the last evidence that lakes once covered this region of Mars. That’s because the rock layers here formed in drier settings than regions explored earlier in the mission. The area’s sulfates – salty minerals are thought to have been left behind when water was drying to a trickle.
        Rippled Rock Textures: Billions of years ago, waves on the surface of a shallow lake stirred up sediment at the lake bottom. Over time, the sediment formed into rocks with rippled textures that are the clearest evidence of waves and water that NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover has ever found. Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS.

So Curiosity’s team was surprised to discover the mission’s clearest evidence yet of ancient water ripples that formed within lakes. Billions of years ago, waves on the surface of a shallow lake stirred up sediment at the lake bottom, over time creating rippled textures left in rock.

“This is the best evidence of water and waves that we’ve seen in the entire mission,” said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity’s project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “We climbed through thousands of feet of lake deposits and never saw evidence like this and now we found it in a place we expected to be dry.

        <h3>
            The goal of the Mars Exploration Program is to explore Mars and to provide a continuous flow of scientific information and discovery through a carefully selected series of robotic orbiters, landers and mobile laboratories interconnected by a high-bandwidth Mars/Earth communications network.
            NASA’s Mars Exploration Program (MEP) is seeking feedback from the science community for its draft plan for the future of the program. MEP is excited to share this draft vision for the program’s future, entitled “Plan for a Sustainable Future for Science at Mars.” The plan is intended to look toward the next 20 years and center on community-responsive science themes. The draft plan suggests a new strategic paradigm designed to: send low-cost, high-value science missions to Mars at a higher frequency; develop new mission-enabling technologies; and address critical infrastructure at Mars. We are seeking community feedback at <a href="HQ-MEP@mail.nasa.gov">Nasa Mail</a>

        <h4>
            ATMOSPHERE
        </h4> 
        <p>Mars’ atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon dioxide (about 96 percent), with minor amounts of other gases such as argon and nitrogen. The atmosphere is very thin, however, and the atmospheric pressure at the surface of Mars is only about 0.6 percent of Earth’s (101,000 pascals).

            Scientists think that Mars may have had a thicker atmosphere early in its history, and data from NASA spacecraft (the<a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/maven/">MAVEN mission</a>) indicate that Mars has lost significant amounts of its atmosphere through time. The primary culprit for Mars’ atmospheric loss is the solar wind!</p>
            <h5>ASTROBIOLOGY</h5>
            <p>Astrobiology is a relatively new field of study, where scientists from a variety of disciplines (astronomy, biology, geology, physics, etc.) work together to understand the potential for life to exist beyond Earth. However, the exploration of Mars has been intertwined with NASA’s search for life from the beginning. The twin Viking landers of 1976 were NASA’s first life detection mission, and although the results from the experiments failed to detect life in the Martian regolith, and resulted in a long period with fewer Mars missions, it was not the end of the fascination that the Astrobiology science community had for the red planet.

                The field of Astrobiology saw a resurgence due to the controversy surrounding the possible fossil life in the ALH84001 meteorite, and from the outsized public response to this announcement, and subsequent interest from Congress and the White House, NASA’s Astrobiology Program was formed.
                
                Also at this time, NASA’s Mars Exploration Program began to investigate Mars with an increasing focus on missions to the Red Planet. The Pathfinder Mission and Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) were sent to Mars to “Follow the Water,” recognizing that liquid water is necessary for life to exist on Earth. After establishing that Mars once had significant amount of water on its surface, the Mars Science Laboratory (which includes the Curiosity rover) was sent to Mars to determine whether Mars had the right ingredients in the rocks to host life, signaling a shift to the next theme of “Explore Habitability”. MEP developed the Mars 2020 Rover Mission to determine whether life may have left telltale signatures in the rocks on Mars’s surface, a further shift to the current science theme “Seek the Signs of Life”.</p>
